## Technologies, Approaches, Fails and Wins

### Tech & Approaches

* Materialize
  * We used Materialize framework
* Custom css
  * I used a lot of my own CSS but I feel it could have been better
* Modals
  * We made modals for our new blog posts and started on making them for sign in
* Approaches
  * We wanted to make something with positive vibes!
* Responsive Design
* Authorization
  * We rendered a signup form.


### Struggles

* Mimi
  *  The modals were much harder than I thought they would be, I think if I had another day or so to make them properly for the Auth components I would have had it working. But I at least got it working for the blog posts
* Molly
  *  The authorization was very difficult in React. I worked on it for days. First I mixed html files and was using auth notes from Unit 2, which wasn't working. Then I tried using Okta. Luckily, Karolin informed me that Okta would bring a user to its page, which wasn't the experience we would have wanted. I finally achieved some working code, and Mimi got a signup form to render, though we never achieved full functionality.
* Lily
  *  Trying not to interfere with other's files they are working with while making progress on your own projects. I realized that two of the features I wanted to add relied on an earlier step being completed. There were a lot of things that tampered with files others were working with, for example while I could create the separate files for the profiles customization, most of the work had to be done in the app.js after the auth was done. I was advised by TA that I could not pre-code stuff in because it would continue to cause things to crash.


### Failed Attempts

* Authorization
  * We have some working code in that a login and sign up form do render to the page, but they don't link to a database.
* Image Uploader
  * Mimi was able to get one to upload locally but not to the atlas db
* Creating profile setting and customizations before the authorization. Apparently trying to make something out of order doesn't help. Lily would try to precode things but it would break the entire app so we had to ditch some code in order to get the app to work properly.

### Wins!

* We had very little conflicts with github
* We worked great as a team!
* We got to research a lot and learn a lot about features of react.

## About

This app, code-fatale shown as Ifatale  was modeled after a Nicklelodeon show ICarly. The intention is for a user to be able to sign up, login, and be able to post, edit, and delete on the blogs.

React, is the main javascript library for building the user interface. Using full crud each of the blog posts are able to be manipulated independently displaying a picture, title, mood, post and a timestamp.  Materialized was for the css.

Meetings were held regularly through discord and zoom and the project timeline was organized on a trello board so the minimum requirements could be met early so that stretch goals could be more accessible.

Future goals for this app would be to make the login and sign up work seemlessly, video uploads, and profile customization.
