## Technologies, Approaches, Fails and Wins

### Tech & Approaches

* Materialize
  * We used Materialize framework
* Custom css
  * I used a lot of my own CSS but I feel it could have been better
* Modals
  * We made modals for our new blog posts and started on making them for sign in
* Approaches
  * We wanted to make something with positive vibes!
* Responsive Design
* Add more
  * blah blah


### Struggles

* Mimi
  *  The modals were much harder than I thought they would be, I think if I had another day or so to make them properly for the Auth components I would have had it working. But I at least got it working for the blog posts
* Molly
  *  Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet
* Lily
  *  Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet


### Failed Attempts

* Authorization
  * Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet, Consectetur Adipiscing Elit, Sed Do Eiusmod Tempor Incididunt Ut Labore Et Dolore Magna Aliqua.
* Image Uploader
  * Mimi was able to get one to upload locally but not to the atlas db


### Wins!

* We had very little conflicts with github
* We worked great as a team!

## About

This app, code-fatale shown as Ifatale  was modeled after a Nicklelodeon show ICarly. The intention is for a user to be able to sign up, login, and be able to post, edit, and delete on the blogs.

React, is the main javascript library for building the user interface. Using full crud each of the blog posts are able to be manipulated independently show casing a picture, title, mood, post and a timestamp.  Materialized was for the css.

Meetings were held regularly through discord and zoom and the project timeline was organized on a trello board so the minimum requirements could be met early so that stretch goals could be more accessible.

Future goals for this app would be to make the login and sign up work seemlessly, video uploads, and profile customization.
