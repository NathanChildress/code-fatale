## About

This app, code-fatale shown as Ifatale  was modeled after a Nicklelodeon show ICarly. The intention is for a user to be able to sign up, login, and be able to post, edit, and delete on the blogs.

React, is the main javascript library for building the user interface. Using full crud each of the blog posts are able to be manipulated independently show casing a picture, title, mood, post and a timestamp.  Materialized was for the css.

Meetings were held regularly through discord and zoom and the project timeline was organized on a trello board so the minimum requirements could be met early so that stretch goals could be more accessible.

Future goals for this app would be to make the login and sign up work seemlessly, video uploads, and profile customization.
